I am a Software Engineer who has been working in computer science for about six years now. I am looking to work in back end development with a focus on product scale. My interest focus on dealing with technologies such as networking, low level work that brings you closer to the metal and real world services that add value like a device you can hold instead of ads. Placement with a good team that works well together is very important. I am looking for an environment where you know what your neighbor is doing, you can bounce ideas off them and have the ability to learn the product as a whole. The best thing from my perspective is to have mentoring available with some on-boarding process. From my experience I have had quite a few trial by fire starts to my jobs. While I have always survived the fire it has seemed to be a waste of the initial motivation to do your best.

There have been four places I have worked in the past. The first of them was my long term internship position with the WSU (Winona State University) Software Development & Testing Lab. There we focused on QA work for a local embedded device company. My first project focused on automating testing for their development tools with their devices. It was a good opening to experience their embedded devices and get an idea of what their products would be used for. The second project was focusing on an IoT platform where we were working to test the service from both the front end using selenium, the web services interface and stress test the number of device connections that could be established to the server through the network. It was great to see the multiple tier approach to solving the problem. This role focused on development with both Java and Python.

My next position was with a web development group that was doing a CRM tool for states to do auditing for personal and business tax auditing. Focus in web development using HTML and JavaScript. It was not a culture fit for me I was looking for a more collaborative work environment and a more engaging product development. Soon after I joined Hobbs Madison conducting contract work for a large bank headquartered in my local area doing development for a web application that joined their front end services to their back end byte level mainframe interfaces. Work there was at its peak for bank productivity; They were redesigning a product that had been in maintenance mode for 15 or so years. There I got to experience a large development process where goals/deadlines were structured to keep up a fast pace to meet company deadlines. This role primarily focused on development with both HTML and JavaScript.

My most recent experience was with Tech Mahindra doing release engineering at Google. There I did development on improving their release procedures by making releases faster and less error prone. The role required working with several groups across the company such as SREs, Developers, compiler optimization and other release engineers to stay up to date on what was happening with internal tools. Day to day I worked on automation, incremental release process improvements and with the manual process for verifying binaries were working at scale without crashing. Some notable things that I worked on were. Cleaning up 14 different release processes to work with new constraints needed from server upgrades & new security constraints. Automated release procedures to remove one third of manual process time for large releases. Created fully automated release procedures for 23 internal developer tools used by 3 different internal teams and there were new teams planing to add more tools to the process when I left.

I look forward to discussing with you how I can actively contribute to your companyâ€™s future success.
